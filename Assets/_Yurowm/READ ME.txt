Thank you for purchase this awesome asset! Yes, I know you like it! :) So I think this is a time to research it and to leave your awesome review on the store page! This is very important for me and I hope you will leave it!

I'm sure you will have questions, so I'm starting to write the user manual for you. This isn't final version, I'm writting it right now and I'll write it in the future, when you'll ask me different important questions. You can find the user manual here:
